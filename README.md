You will need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) setup on your machine. That will output the built distributables to `./dist/*` .

**Step 1.** Use NPM (Locate your current directory of project, and enter the following command.) or download the latest version from [Github](https://github.com/xizon/f-curator). For nodejs you have to install some dependencies.

```sh
$ sudo npm install f-curator
```

Or clone the repo to get all source files including build scripts: 

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/xizon/f-curator.git

**Step 2.** First, using an absolute path into your `"f-curator/"` folder directory.

```sh
$ cd /{your_directory}/f-curator
```


**Step 3.** Before doing all dev stuff make sure you have `Node 10+` installed. After that, run the following code in the main directory to install the node module dependencies.

```sh
